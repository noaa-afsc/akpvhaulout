# Abstract

This document describes the process of querying telemetry data and assigning
tidal covariates to Alaska harbor seal haul-out behavior. The data for haul-out
behavior are initially queried from the PEP central PostgreSQL database and
tidy'd into an open dataset ready for downstream analysis. The tidal
calculations are determined via the XTide library which must be installed along
with the `tidextractr` package (available on Github).
